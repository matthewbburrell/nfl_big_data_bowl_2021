# NFL Big Data Bowl 2021

### Evaluating Defensive Performance on Passing Plays

The NFL's 2021 big data kaggle challenge seeks to improve techniques for analyzing the defensive part of the game which has trailed behind offensive part of the game. In past NFL Kaggle challenges, the focus was on offensive plays which analyze the quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers. The NFL goal of the project is to identify players, teams and strategic advantages on the defensive side of the ball, which would be a significant breakthrough for the game. 

The data for this competition is from the NFL's Next Gen Stats data.
